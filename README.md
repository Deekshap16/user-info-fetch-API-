# Indian User Information (Fetch API Project)

## 🎯 Objective
A simple web project that uses the **JavaScript Fetch API** to get user data from a public API and display it in a styled format.  
The default API (`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users`) is used for learning purposes, but the fetched data is replaced with **Indian names, emails, and addresses** for better presentation.
